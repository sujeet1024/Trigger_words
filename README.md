# Trigger_words

1. This tool was built to detect multiple trigger words listed in the link below

2. The dataset used for training the model can be downloaded from the tensorflow challenge through the link: 
[Tensorflow challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge/data)


3. For preprocessing the audio data pydub module has been used here, to use pydub you first need to set up ffmpeg package which aids in processing the audio data

    - For unix systems:
      ```
      sudo apt install ffmpeg
      ```

    - For windows systems:
      ```
      download the ffmpeg lib, extract, and add the ***\bin path to the environment path
      ```
